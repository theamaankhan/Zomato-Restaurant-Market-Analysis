🍽️ Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Zomato restaurant data to uncover insights related to pricing, ratings, geography, cuisines, and service availability.
The objective is to transform raw datasets into actionable insights using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques.

This project is designed as a resume-ready portfolio project for a fresher, demonstrating strong analytical thinking, data storytelling, and business understanding.

📂 Dataset Information

The analysis uses two datasets:

zomato.csv
Contains restaurant-level details such as city, country code, cuisines, average cost for two, price range, ratings, votes, online delivery, and table booking options.

Country-Code.xlsx
Maps country codes to country names and currencies, enabling meaningful geographical analysis.

⭐ Key Insights
🌍 Geographical Insights

The dataset is heavily concentrated in India, which dominates restaurant listings.

A small number of countries significantly influence overall platform trends.

🏙️ City-Level Trends (India)

Major metropolitan cities host the highest number of restaurants.

These cities also show higher average dining costs, reflecting urban demand and premium dining options.

💰 Pricing Patterns

Most restaurants fall into Low and Medium price categories.

High and Very High priced restaurants form a relatively small segment.

Pricing alone does not strongly influence customer ratings.

⭐ Ratings & Customer Perception

A large share of restaurants are rated “Average” or remain “Not rated”.

Only a small percentage achieve “Excellent” ratings, indicating strong competition and scope for quality improvement.

🚚 Service Availability

The majority of restaurants do not offer online delivery or table booking.

Online delivery and reservation services are concentrated in select countries and major cities.

This highlights a clear opportunity for digital service expansion.

🍽️ Cuisine Insights

Lower price ranges are dominated by casual and fast-service cuisines.

Higher price ranges include more international and premium cuisines, reflecting changing consumer preferences.

📈 Business Value

Restaurants can use these insights to optimize pricing and service strategies.

Food platforms can identify high-growth cities and markets.

Demonstrates how EDA supports data-driven decision-making in real-world business contexts.
